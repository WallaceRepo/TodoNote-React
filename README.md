I created Todo Note with Material-ui dateTimePicker labriary. It also uses Simple HTTP JSON Server on localhost for database.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server` 
 Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser. To install Basic http JSON server: 
 npm i -g serve.
 Before running server, remember, server needs build folder done in React. 
 
 ### serve -s build -p 8000 \ It will serve webapp on localhost 8000.

Launches the JSON server in port 5000 watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. .\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
